# Aladinko - carpet cleaning landing page


*Note: It's in Slovenian, as the client was from there.*

This project includes only a landing page, for a carpet cleaning company based in Maribor, Slovenia. It's build using only GatsbyJS, no backend (cms) was used.

In this way, I made sure the client has to pay the minimal amount (only hosting), and get slick looking fast and SEO friendly website.

Initially I was using nextJS for this project, because I hadn't yet learned about GatsbyJS. 

After learning about gatsby, I realised that this project is perfect for it, switiching to gatsby has improved performance (loading speed), and SEO by a ton.
